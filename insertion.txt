# insertion.py - Inserts a file into a sorted filing cabinet

Consider the task of insertion itself. Imagine that you
have a filing cabinet whose files are already perfectly sorted. If
someone hands you one new file and asks you to insert it into
the right (sorted) position in the filing cabinet, how do you
accomplish that?

The following method describes a reasonable algorithm:

1. Select the highest file in the filing cabinet. 

2. Compare the file you have selected with the file to
insert.

3. If the file you have selected is lower than the file to
insert, place the file to insert one position behind that
file.

4. If the file you have selected is higher than the file to
insert, select the next highest file in the filing cabinet.

5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until you have inserted your file or
compared it with every existing file.
