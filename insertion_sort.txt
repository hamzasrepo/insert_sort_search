# insertion_sort.py - Sorts an unsorted list via insertion

Imagine that you've been asked to sort all the files in a filing
cabinet. Each file has a number assigned to it, and you need to
rearrange the files so that the file with the lowest number is
first in the cabinet, the file with the highest number is last, 
and the files' numbers proceed in order in between.

Insertion Sort relies on looking at each item in a list 
one at a time and inserting it into a new list that 
ends up being correctly sorted. 

insertion_sort() takes an unsorted list one at a time and 
uses our insertion algorithm to insert it correctly into 
a new, sorted list. 

In filing cabinet terms: 

1. We start with an unsorted filing cabinet and an empty cabinet 
2. We remove the first element of our old unsorted
cabinet and add it to our new empty cabinet, using the
insertion algorithm. 
3. We do the same with the second element of the old cabinet, 
then the third, and so on until we have inserted every element 
of the old cabinet into the new cabinet.
